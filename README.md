<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, I have build a Tic Tac Toe game. The project follows the lesson about Factory Functions and The Module Pattern so the main goal is to put into practice those concepts along with the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes/objects and how to access their methods and attributes.

### Features

This Tic Tac Toe game has a modern touch to it and I am calling it <strong>Super Tic Tac Toe</strong>.

- User can play with different characters.
- User can switch between the characters in middle of the game.
- User can play Multiplayer or with computer.
- Computer have two modes easy and hard mode.
- Hard mode is build with the <Strong>Min-Max-Algorithm</strong>. 
- In Hard mode AI plays the best possible move which means user can not win in any condition.
- Feel free to try your luck. <strong>üòÉ</strong>  I hope enjoy playing it.
